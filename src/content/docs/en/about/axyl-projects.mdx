# Introduction

One of the founding principles of The Autists is to lead. We are willing to be the first, we are willing
to be the risk takers, and we are willing to be the ones who are blamed when things go wrong. This is because our
goals are those of a progressive group tied to a staunch conservative leadership, and we know that the advancement
of open source software will be what keeps the world alive in the future.

# What we do:
<br>
</br>
### Training:
<br>
</br>
There is an ongoing investigation into the education systems that exist in America, and around the world at that.
And nobody knows this better than the people of the STEM Jobs and Career Paths. At The Autists, we do things differently.
We encourage you to learn, helping provide resources and drive up your curiousity, as we know that will provide a much
better education when you work on our projects, and later when you go and join the workforce working on the technology
that you have helped build, used to help build, or being learning to master during your time with us.

### Leadership:
<br>
</br>
This is something that will be taught to everyone who goes thru any of our programs, leadership is not something that
you can take lightly. People expect to be lead in the way that you expect to be followed. There are many things that people
do not like to account for when it comes to leadership, and these are things that The Autists takes seriously, you can
find the names off everyone who is on our leading teams in the [Team](/en/team/about-the-team) Section of the website
and we wear our positions proudly.
