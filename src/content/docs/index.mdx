      We have a variety of different projects, and we have various reasons for why we have picked to move forward with these projects. If you would like to submit projects for
      us to look at, you can do that in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/axyl)

      We are always evaluating new projects and ideas Read more [Here](/en/projects/about-projects)

  <Card title="Our Languages and Tools" icon="open-book">
      We use a variety of languages in our projects, ranging from C, to C#, C++, and Zig, to Lua, Rust, and JavaScript, with a lot of other languages in between.
      if you would like to help, do not be afraid that you dont know a language we use, as even a yaml specialist would be of great help
      We also use Docker, Kubernetes, github, gitlab, grafana, gitea, forgejo, aws, gcp, digital ocean, ghost, and more.
